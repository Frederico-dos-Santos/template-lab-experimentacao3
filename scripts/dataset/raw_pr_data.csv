This improvement not only streamlines the handling of such PRs but also fixes a previously identified issue.Before the ChangePreviously, when you created a pull request from a forked repository, any files changed in the target branch after the PR creation would erroneously appear as part of the PR's changed files. This made it difficult to distinguish between the actual changes introduced by the PR and subsequent changes made directly to the target branch.What Has ChangedWith this update, a pull request from a fork will now only include the files that were explicitly changed in the fork. This ensures that the list of changed files in a PR accurately reflects the contributions from the fork, without being muddled by unrelated changes to the target branch.What's ChangedUpgraded to v43.0.1 by @​tj-actions-bot in tj-actions/changed-files#2004chore(deps): lock file maintenance by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#2005chore(deps): update typescript-eslint monorepo to v7.4.0 by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#2006fix: bug with prs from forks returning incorrect set of changed files by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2007fix: check for setting remote urls for forks by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2009fix: update to add the fork remote by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2010fix: update previous sha for forks by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2011fix: ensure the fork remote doesn't exists before creating it by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2012chore: update description of other_deleted_files output by @​tonyejack1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2008Updated README.md by @​tj-actions-bot in tj-actions/changed-files#2013remove: unused code by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2014chore: update description of outputs removing asterisks  by @​tonyejack1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2015Updated README.md by @​tj-actions-bot in tj-actions/changed-files#2016New Contributors@​tonyejack1 made their first contribution in tj-actions/changed-files#2008Full Changelog: tj-actions/changed-files@v43.0.1...v44.0.0v43.0.1What's ChangedUpgraded to v43 by @​tj-actions-bot in tj-actions/changed-files#1990chore(deps): update dependency @​types/node to v20.11.28 by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#1991chore(deps): lock file maintenance by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#1992chore(deps): update typescript-eslint monorepo to v7.3.0 by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#1993chore(deps): update dependency @​types/node to v20.11.29 by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#1994Bump @​typescript-eslint/parser from 7.3.0 to 7.3.1 by @​dependabot in tj-actions/changed-files#1996chore(deps): update dependency @​typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin to v7.3.1 by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#1997Bump @​typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin from 7.3.0 to 7.3.1 by @​dependabot in tj-actions/changed-files#1995chore(deps): update dependency @​types/node to v20.11.30 by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#1998chore: update inputs.ts adding comment about fetch_depth by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2000fix: remove warning with detecting the local git repository when using Github's REST API by @​jackton1 in tj-actions/changed-files#2002chore(deps): update dependency typescript to v5.4.3 by @​renovate in tj-actions/changed-files#2003...

The code starts by importing the necessary modules: pygame and pygame.locals. The pygame.locals module provides constants for event types, keycodes, and other useful values.After that, the Pygame library is initialized using pygame.init(). This step is necessary before using any Pygame functions or classes.Next, the game window is set up using the pygame.display.set_mode() function. In the example, the window size is set to 800x600 pixels, but you can modify these values to fit your game's requirements. The pygame.display.set_caption() function is used to set the title of the game window.The code then enters a game loop, controlled by the running variable. Inside the loop, events are handled using a for loop that iterates over pygame.event.get(). This retrieves a list of all the events that have occurred since the last time this function was called. The code checks for the QUIT event, which is triggered when the user tries to close the game window. If this event is detected, the running variable is set to False, and the game loop will exit.Inside the game loop, you can update your game's logic and perform any necessary calculations or modifications. This is where you would handle user input, update the positions of game objects, check for collisions, and implement the game's rules.After updating the game logic, the code clears the game window by filling it with a black color using window.fill((0, 0, 0)). You can change the color by providing a different RGB value as a tuple.Finally, the updated game screen is rendered by calling pygame.display.update(). This function updates the contents of the game window to reflect any changes made.The game loop continues until the running variable is set to False, typically when the user closes the game window. Once the loop exits, Pygame is cleaned up using pygame.quit().[Insert URL to the list here][Explain what this list is about and why it should be included here]By submitting this pull request I confirm I've read and complied with the below requirements 🖖Please read it multiple times.

It helped me see through my boyfriend's lies. His Instagram account, which used to make me happy, turned into a treasure trove of evidence. With Muyern Trust Hacker, I found out he was flirting with other girls. It hurt, but it also gave me the proof I needed to confront him. When I confronted him, I learned he had cheated on me many times and had even fathered three children with different women. It was a shock, but it helped me break free from his lies. I realized I deserved better. After we broke up, I found comfort in knowing I dodged a bullet. The experience taught me to trust myself and set higher standards for treating me. Thanks to Muyern Trust Hacker and the support of my loved ones, I'm moving forward stronger than before. The discovery of Muyern Trust Hacker was like finding a lifeline in a sea of confusion. It was surprisingly easy to use and navigate, even for someone like me who isn't an IT expert. The tool allowed me to track my boyfriend's online activity, revealing the extent of his deceit and infidelity. His Instagram profile, once a source of joy and connection, became a haunting reminder of his betrayal. Every flirtatious comment and private message uncovered by Muyern Trust Hacker felt like a stab in the heart. Yet, it was also empowering to have concrete evidence of his wrongdoing. Confronting him was one of the hardest things I've ever done but also the most liberating. Armed with the evidence provided by Muyern Trust Hacker, I could confront him confidently and finally end the toxic cycle of lies and manipulation. What I uncovered was beyond anything I could have imagined. Not only had he cheated on me multiple times, but he had also fathered three children with three different women. It was a devastating blow, but it also opened my eyes to the true extent of his betrayal. Walking away from the relationship was a painful decision, but it was also a necessary one. With the support of my friends and family and the clarity provided by Muyern Trust Hacker, I found the strength to move forward. In the aftermath of the breakup, I found solace in knowing I had dodged a bullet. The experience, though painful, has taught me valuable lessons about self-worth and resilience. Thanks to Muyern Trust Hacker, I was able to reclaim my dignity and find closure in the aftermath of heartbreak.

Subsequent elements will not warn.There's a special case we have to account for: when a static ""key"" prop is defined after a spread, the modern JSX transform outputs createElement instead of jsx.

We've done this for two reasons.One reason is that there are certain prop names that are reserved by React, like key and (before React 19) ref. These are not actual props and are not observable by the target component; React uses them internally but removes them from the props object before passing them to userspace.The second reason is that the classic JSX runtime, createElement, is both a compiler target and a public API that can be called manually. Therefore, we can't assume that the props object that is passed into createElement won't be mutated by userspace code after it is passed in.However, the new JSX runtime, jsx, is not a public API — it's solely a compiler target, and the compiler will always pass a fresh, inline object. So the only reason to clone the props is if a reserved prop name is used.In React 19, ref is no longer a reserved prop name, and key will only appear in the props object if it is spread onto the element. (Because if key is statically defined, the compiler will pass it as a separate argument to the jsx function.) So the only remaining reason to clone the props object is if key is spread onto the element, which is a rare case, and also triggers a warning in development.In a future release, we will not remove a spread key from the props object. (But we'll still warn.) We'll always pass the object straight through.The expected impact is much faster JSX element creation, which in many apps is a significant slice of the overall runtime cost of rendering.",1629,4,1

It's also not possible to create a faithful File subclass in all environments without it actually being backed by a file.This implementation isn't great but at least it works. It creates a few indirections. This is because we need to be able to asynchronously emit the buffers but we have to ""block"" the parent object from resolving while it's loading.Ideally, we should be able to create the Blob on the client early and then stream in it lazily. Because the Blob API doesn't guarantee that the data is available synchronously. Unfortunately, the native APIs doesn't have this. We could implement custom versions of all the data read APIs but then the blobs still wouldn't work with native APIs.

Then I just rely on Flight deduping to refer to that. I refer to the same thing by referential equality so that we can associate a Server Component parent in DebugInfo with an owner.If you suspend and replay a Server Component, we have to restore the same owner.

This used to be the only recoverable error so it didn't need extra context but now we need to distinguish them. When we log these to reportError it's confusing to just see the error because you didn't see anything error on the page. It's also hard to group them together as one.In this PR, I remove the unnecessary context for hydration mismatches.For hydration and concurrent errors, I now wrap them in an error that describes that what happened but then use the new cause field to link the original error so we can keep that as the cause. The error that happened was that hydration client rendered or you deopted to sync render, the cause of that error is some other error.For server errors, we control the Error object so I already had added some context to that error object's message. Since we hide the message in prod, it's nice not to have the raw message in DEV neither. We could potentially split these into two errors for parity though.",1548,4,1

This different from function components, where you have to do something extra to attach a ref to an instance, like passing the ref to useImperativeHandle.Existing class component code is written with the assumption that a ref will not be passed through as a prop. For example, class components that act as indirections often spread this.props onto a child component. To maintain this expectation, we should remove the ref from the props object (""consume"" it) before passing it to lifecycle methods. Without this change, much existing code will break because the ref will attach to the inner component instead of the outer one.This is not an issue for function components because we used to warn if you passed a ref to a function component. Instead, you had to use forwardRef, which also implements this ""consuming"" behavior.There are a few places in the reconciler where we modify the fiber's internal props object before passing it to userspace. The trickiest one is class components, because the props object gets exposed in many different places, including as a property on the class instance.This was already accounted for when we added support for setting default props on a lazy wrapper (i.e. React.lazy that resolves to a class component).In all of these same places, we will also need to remove the ref prop when enableRefAsProp is on.Closes #28602",1487,4,1
facebook/react,MERGED,Differentiate null and undefined in Custom Elements - removing sets to undefined,28716,2024-04-02 15:26:23+00:00,2024-04-02 15:48:27+00:00,2024-04-02 15:48:27+00:00,0.37,APPROVED,1,2,76,7,"In React DOM, in general, we don't differentiate between null and undefined because we expect to target DOM APIs.  When we're setting a property on a Custom Element, in the new heuristic, the goal is to allow passing whatever data type instead of normalizing it. Switching between undefined and null as an explicit value should therefore be respected.However, in this mode if undefined is used for the initial value, we don't actually set the property at all. If passing null we will now initialize it to the value null. Meaning undefined kind of represents the default.Removing PropertiesThere is a pretty complex edge case which is what should happen when a prop used to exist but was removed from the props object. This doesn't have any kind of defined semantics. It really should mean - return to ""default"". Because in the declarative world it means the same as if it was just created - i.e. we can't just leave it as it was.The closest might be delete object.property but that's not really the intended way that properties on custom elements / classes are supposed to operate. Additionally, for a property to even hit our heuristic it must pass the in test and must exist to being with so the default must have a value.Since the point of these properties is to contain any kind of type, there isn't really a conceptual default value. E.g. a numeric default value might be zero 0 while a default string might be empty """" and default object might null. Additionally, the conceptual default can really be initialized to anything. There's also varied precedence in the ecosystem here and really no consensus. Anything we pick would be kind of wrong, so we used to just pick null.The safest way to consume a Custom Element is to always pass the same set of props.JS does have a concept of a ""default value"" though and that is described as the value undefined. That's why default argument / object property initializers are initialized if the value is undefined.The problem with using undefined as value is that you shouldn't actually ever set the value of a class property to undefined. A property should always be initialized to some value. It can't be left missing and shouldn't be initialized to the value undefined for hidden class optimizations. If we just mutate it to be undefined it would be potentially bad for perf and shouldn't really be the value after removing property - it should be returned to default.Every property should really have a setter to be useful since it is what is used to trigger reactivity when it changes. Sometimes you can just use the properties passively when something else happens but most of the time it should be a setter but to reach parity with DOM it should really be always so that the active value can be normalized.Those setters can have default argument initializers to represent what the default value should be. Therefore Custom Element properties should be used like this:class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {  _textLabel = '';  _price = 0;  _items = null;    constructor() {    super();  }  set textLabel(value = '') {    this._textLabel = value;  }  get textLabel() {    return this._textLabel;  }  set price(value = 0) {    this._price = value;  }  get price() {    return this._price;  }  set items(value = null) {    this._items = value;  }  get items() {    return this._items;  }}The default initializer can be used to initialize a value back to its original default when undefined is passed to it. Therefore, we pass undefined, not because we expect that to be the value of a property but because that's the value that represents ""return to default"".This fixes #28203 but not really for the reason specified in the issue. We don't expect you to actually store the undefined value but to use a setter to set the property to something else that represents the default. When we initialize the element the first time, we won't set anything if it's the value undefined so we assume that the property initializers running in the constructor is going to set the same default value as if we set the property to undefined.cc @josepharhar",4169,5,2

This ensures that if we have nodes that otherwise line up correctly such as if they're the same type of Component but in a different order, then we don't accidentally transfer state or attributes to the wrong one.If we didn't do this e.g. attributes like image src might not line up with the text. E.g. you might show the wrong profile picture with the wrong name. However, the main reason we do this is because it's a security/privacy concern if state from the original node can transfer to the other one. For example if you start typing into a text field to reply to a story but then it turns out that the hydration was in a different order, you might submit that text into a different story than you intended. Similarly, if you've already clicked an item and that gets replayed using Action replaying or is synchronously force hydrated - that click might end up applying to a different item in the list than you intended. E.g. liking the wrong photo.Unfortunately a common case where this happens is when Google Translate is applied to a page. It'll always cause mismatches and recreate the tree. Most of the time this wouldn't be visible to users because it'd just recreate to the same thing and then translate again. It can affect metrics that trace when this hydration happened though.Meta can use this flag to decide if they favor this perf metric over the risk to user privacy.This is similar to the old enableClientRenderFallbackOnTextMismatch flag except this flag doesn't patch up the text when there's a mismatch. Because we don't have the patching anymore. The assumption is that it is safe to ignore the safety concern because we assume it's a match and therefore favoring not patching it will lead to better perf.",1949,5,3

So Prettier is installed anyway and everything works.But if some project has Prettier@3, then @vue/compiler-sfc uses project's prettier and fails.There was the same issue early in component-compiler-utils. See:vuejs/component-compiler-utils@aea1b79vuejs/component-compiler-utils#89This PR specifies Prettier as an optionalDependency of @vue/compiler-sfc. With specified dependency, it will use prettier@2 even if a project has prettier@3.P.S. I used the same versions as it was in the component-compiler-utils. It seems it has the same code.Alternative solution: make @vue/compiler-sfc compatible with both Prettier@""1 || 2"" and Prettier@3. The problem is that it will make the compile function async.",1930,2,0

It uses FastAPI to provide REST endpoints for a variety of tasks, including text embeddings, completions, semantic similarity measurements, and more. It supports a wide range of document types, including those requiring OCR, and audio files for transcription. Embeddings are cached in SQLite for efficiency, and RAM Disks are used for quick loading of multiple LLMs. The toolkit is accessible via a Swagger UI and integrates with various technologies like FAISS for semantic search and the Fast Vector Similarity library for advanced similarity measures.What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?FastAPI Integration: Swiss Army Llama is fully integrated with FastAPI, providing a Swagger page for easy access and interaction with its REST API, a feature not commonly found in similar projects.Comprehensive Caching: The project implements automatic caching for all processes, significantly enhancing efficiency and reducing redundant computations. This level of automatic caching is not standard in similar tools.RAM Disk Utilization: It uniquely uses RAM Disk to accelerate the loading of models, providing a substantial speed advantage in accessing and using various LLMs.Broad File Format Support with Textract: The integration with Textract allows the Swiss Army Llama to handle a wide array of file formats, far exceeding the capabilities of similar projects which often have limited file format support.Integration with Whisper: The project is integrated with OpenAI's Whisper model for advanced audio transcription, a feature that is not typically included in similar LLM toolkits.BNF Grammar Tools: It includes specialized tools for working with Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammars, offering unique capabilities in generating structured LLM outputs based on specific grammar rules.Support for Token-Level Embeddings: In addition to standard embeddings, Swiss Army Llama supports token-level embeddings, providing more nuanced data representation and analysis. This level of detail in embeddings is not commonly available in similar projects.Features:Versatile File Processing: Supports an extensive array of file types including PDFs, Word documents, images, and audio files, with advanced text preprocessing and OCR capabilities.Comprehensive Embedding Features: Offers both fixed-sized and token-level embeddings, with the unique introduction of combined feature vectors for comparing strings of unequal length.Advanced Semantic Search: Combines FAISS vector searching with sophisticated similarity measures like spearman_rho, kendall_tau, and jensen_shannon_similarity, enabling nuanced text comparisons.Efficient Caching and RAM Disk Usage: Implements efficient caching in SQLite and optional RAM Disk usage for faster model loading and execution.Comprehensive Logging and Real-Time Monitoring: Features a real-time log file viewer in the browser, and uses Redis for efficient request handling and logging.Interactive and User-Friendly Interface: Integrates with Swagger UI for easy access and management of large result sets, making it user-friendly and easily integrable into applications.Customizable and Scalable: Built on FastAPI, it is highly scalable and customizable with configurable settings for response formats and parallel inference.Multiple Model and Measure Support: Accommodates a variety of models and measures, providing flexibility and customization according to user needs.Specialized Grammar-Enforced Text Completions: Offers the ability to generate multiple text completions with specified grammar, enhancing structured LLM output.What is this Python project?Describe features.What's the difference between this Python project and similar ones?Enumerate comparisons.--Anyone who agrees with this pull request could submit an Approve review to it.",4038,2,0

This can be achieved by breaking down the merge_sort function into smaller, more modular functions with descriptive names that clearly outline each step of the algorithm. Additionally, I suggest adding comments to explain the logic behind key sections of the code, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the algorithm in the future. This enhancement will not only make the code more organized but also facilitate easier debugging and potential future optimizations. I am excited to contribute to this improvement and welcome any feedback or suggestions for further enhancements.""This proposal focuses on improving the code quality and maintainability of the merge sort algorithm implementation.
